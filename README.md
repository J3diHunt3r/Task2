# Getting Started with Create React App

*The development environment used for a React project is Node.js
*The framework used is React
*The language used is Typescript

Creating task src code:
npx create-react-app task2bluesky template/typescript

creation taskes a few minutes....

In the project directory, you then run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\ (through Node.js)
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`
This runs the app in a proper production format so that you can have the best outcome.

##Purpose of the task
-Todo list
-Submit data to a list
-Filter the list
-Complete or not complete tasks
-Collect data from a server using Axios
-Delete a task from the list
-Edit a task from the list

The following libraries needed to be installed
-Material ui/Core and Icons
-Axios for the server to localhost connection

We also had to show our knowledge about Typescript, useState and useEffect:

#Typescript
- like the name refers to "Type" this language is more structured than Javascript in the way that every parameter and prop has to have a type and that different types cannot be used in a concatenate without doing a conversion for that specific function

#useState:
- this is a demonstration of using hooks to manage the state in a function which refers to its parameters.

#useEffect:
- this takes a callback function as an argument and returns it to be clean. This is also used to manage the side effects like API calls and also recycle or re-use a function in more than one cycle
